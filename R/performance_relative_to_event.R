# Title: performance_relative_to_event
# Author: Mary Lofton
# Date: 17MAY23

#Function to render plot of forecast performance relative to an event date
#'@param data data frame with (at a minimum) the following columns:
#'horizon: the forecast horizon
#'depth: depth of the forecast in meters
#'a column whose name is the forecast scoring metric you wish to plot (e.g., "crps")
#'optionally, a column of group ids (e.g., model or team ids, different depths you want to plot, etc.)
#'@param ylims optionally, y axis limits for plotting, provided as c(min, max)
#'@param variable_name character string of target variable, eg., "temperature"
#'@param max_horizon_past maximum days prior to event that you would like to plot scores for as a *negative* number (e.g., -35)
#'@param score character string of the column name containing the score you would like to plot (e.g., "crps")
#'@param group_id character string of the column name containing the variable you would like to group by in plot (e.g., "model_id" or "depth")
#'@param focal_date character string of event date (e.g., date of turnover)
